                    We are still looking to find volunteers for a translation of all AHP-OS output into other

                    If you are willing to support the program,
                    please contact me via the contact link at the bottom of this page.

                    this website alive. 
                    I have running costs for web hosting, certificate, spam protection and maintenance, and want to keep  
                    AHP-OS free for all users. As a donor your account will be kept active without the request for 
                    reactivation, even if you don't access it for a period longer than 3 months.
